I made a electronique baby-foot, this project have : 

2 Nextion screen reference : NX4024T032

2 sensor speed situate in each goal ( a sensor speed is made by 2 laser and 2 laser sensor, when a goal is score the ball hide a laser then the other one, i can have the time take by the ball to travel the cage so... i can calculate the speed. 

4 strip RGB led of 40 led each. 

8 press bouton to controle the screen ( bouton + , bouton -, bouton reset , bouton led,) all of this bouton on each side. 

2 interrupteur, when there is a goal the ball press the interrupteur enable to have a automatique score and a animation of the led when there is a goal.


to controle all this device i use 2 arduino mega who don't communicate between them.
